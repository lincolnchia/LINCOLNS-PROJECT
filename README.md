# LINCOLNS-PROJECT
Lincoln's project
i am created this project as a way to showcase my portfolio and to create a website where i can express myself to people who want to know more about me. I can also use this website to show potential future employer my skill sets and what i could bring to his company.
i created this website to try and convey the person that i am currently am and i achieved this by creating 4 pages of website to do so. I wanted to have a simple page where i could breifly show who i am and what i am currently doing. I also wanted to show what i have gone through
