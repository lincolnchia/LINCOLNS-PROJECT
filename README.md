# LINCOLNS-PROJECT
Lincoln's project
i am created this project as a way to showcase my portfolio and to create a website where i can express myself to people who want to know more about me. I can also use this website to show potential future employer my skill sets and what i could bring to his company.
i created this website to try and convey the person that i am currently am and i achieved this by creating 4 pages of website to do so. I wanted to have a simple page where i could breifly show who i am and what i am currently doing. I also wanted to show what i have gone through to reach the point i am now. I created a project page to showcase what i have done in polytechnic and a contact page for people to contact me and ask question that they want to know.

Feature:
1)i used felx box to ensure that my items in my pages would always resize themselves 
2) I created a menu bar that would appear on the side of the page.
3) In my experience i created it so that the image woiuld lead you to the site that you clicked on.
4) I also made the cards that contain the information to hover up when the moust hovers over it
5) On my project page i created cards that would flip over and display more information on the projects i have done using flip card.
6) On my contact page i created the same thing as my experience page and would link users to my personal work.
7) I created a form for peolpe to input their comments or questions to me.
